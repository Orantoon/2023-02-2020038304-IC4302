Here, we investigate with polymer physics chromatin reorganization of the host genome, in space and time upon SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. We show that re-structuring of A\/B compartments is well explained by a remodulation of intra-compartment homotypic affinities, which leads to the weakening of A-A interactions and enhances A-B mixing. At TAD level, re-arrangements are physically described by a general reduction of the loop extrusion activity coupled with an alteration of chromatin phase-separation properties, resulting in more intermingling between different TADs and spread in space of TADs themselves. In addition, the architecture of loci relevant to the antiviral interferon (IFN) response, such as DDX58 or IFIT, results more variable within the 3D single-molecule population of the infected model, suggesting that viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity. Analysis of time trajectories of pairwise gene-enhancer and higher-order contacts reveals that such variability derives from a more fluctuating dynamics in infected case, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 alters gene regulation by impacting the stability of the contact network in time. Overall, our study provides the first polymer-physics based 4D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infected genome with mechanistic insights on the consequent gene misregulation.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Maria Chiariello","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Alex Abraham","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Simona Bianco","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Andrea Esposito","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Francesca Vercellone","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Mattia Conte","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Andrea Fontana","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Mario Nicodemi","author_inst":"Universita di Napoli Federico II and INFN sezione di Napoli"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2023.07.27.550841","rel_title":"Mapping immunological and host receptor binding determinants of SARS-CoV spike protein utilizing the Qubevirus platform","rel_date":"2023-07-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2023.07.27.550841","rel_abs":"The motifs involved in tropism and immunological interactions of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein were investigated utilizing the Qubevirus platform.

Additionally, recombinant phage expression resulted in the surface exposure of different engineered fragments in an accessible manner. The F6 from S425-525, was found to contain the binding determinant of the recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), with the shortest active binding motif situated between residues S437-492. Upstream, another fragment, F7, containing an overlapping portion of F6 would not bind to rhACE2, confirming not just only that residues were linear but equally also the appropriate structural orientation of F6 upon the Qubevirus. The F6 (S441-460) and other inserts, including F7\/F8 (S601-620) and F10 (S781-800), were demonstrated to contain important immunological determinants through recognition and binding of S protein specific (anti-S) antibodies. An engineered chimeric insert bearing the fusion of all three anti-S reactive epitopes, improved substantially the recognition and binding to their cognate antibodies.

Recently, the RNA-guided ribonuclease CRISPR-Cas13 has been successfully harnessed for such purposes. However, developing assays for detection of genetic variability, for example single-nucleotide polymorphisms, is still challenging and previously described design strategies are not always generalizable. Here, we expanded our characterization of LbuCas13a RNA-detection specificity by performing a combination of experimental RNA mismatch tolerance profiling, molecular dynamics simulations, protein, and crRNA engineering. We found certain positions in the crRNA-target-RNA duplex that are particularly sensitive to mismatches and establish the effect of RNA concentration in mismatch tolerance. Additionally, we determined that shortening the crRNA spacer or modifying the direct repeat of the crRNA leads to stricter specificities. Furthermore, we harnessed our understanding of LbuCas13a allosteric activation pathways through molecular dynamics and structure-guided engineering to develop novel Cas13a variants that display increased sensitivities to single-nucleotide mismatches. We deployed these Cas13a variants and crRNA design strategies to achieve superior discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to wild-type LbuCas13a. Together, our work provides new design criteria and new Cas13a variants for easier-to-implement Cas13-based diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Moises Molina Vargas","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Raven M Osborn","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Souvik Sinha","author_inst":"University of California Riverside"},{"author_name":"Pablo R Arantes","author_inst":"University California Riverside"},{"author_name":"Amun Patel","author_inst":"University of California Riverside"},{"author_name":"Stephen Dewhurst","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Giulia Palermo","author_inst":"University of California Riverside"},{"author_name":"Mitchell R O'Connell","author_inst":"University of Rochester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2023.07.26.23293190","rel_title":"Phenotypic grouping of Catheter-Associated Escherichia coli from COVID-19 isolation wards using Hierarchical clustering in Surabaya","rel_date":"2023-07-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2023.07.26.23293190","rel_abs":"IntroductionModerate to critical COVID-19 patients may be indicated for urinary catheter use due to the risk of immobility and ventilator or oxygen use. In intensive care units, 18-81.7% of all patients use a urinary catheter. Almost all patients with urinary catheters suffered from bacteriuria within 30 catheter-days. Hospital-associated isolate tracing is mainly performed using complex molecular tests that are not vastly available. This study aims to trace catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) isolates using a common hierarchical clustering method that is vastly available\n\nMethodsThis is a descriptive study presenting a collection of Escherichia coli culture data performed by dr. Soetomo Public Hospital microbiology laboratory from March, 26th 2020 to March, 31st 2021. Hierarchical clustering was performed using statistical software using Wards clustering method.\n\nResultsThere are 36 E.coli associated with CAUTI. Isolate biochemistry profile and minimum inhibitory concentrations profiles were clustered into 3 clades for each profile. A total of 9 cluster combinations were found. Cluster-ID 1 was melibiose fermenters, Cluster ID 2 was a non-Arginine utilizer, and Cluster ID-3 was an Arginine utilizer. Cluster MIC A consists of third-generation Cephalosporin resistant isolates, Cluster MIC C was multi-susceptible isolates. The Chi-square test between cluster ID and MIC showed no significant differences between the number of isolates per group (X2, p = .430, CI = 95%).\n\nConclusionCAUTI associated E.coli is divided into 9 clusters. This indicates no cluster dominates the isolates, thus CAUTI is not caused by hospital transmission but by normal flora carried by the admitted patient.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Edbert","author_inst":"Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Pepy Dwi Endraswari","author_inst":"Universitas Airlangga"},{"author_name":"Ni Made Mertaniasih","author_inst":"Airlangga University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2023.07.26.23293155","rel_title":"Impact of Community Masking on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Ontario after Adjustment for Differential Testing by Age and Sex","rel_date":"2023-07-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2023.07.26.23293155","rel_abs":"BackgroundUse of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates.\n\nResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P < 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth.\n\nConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amy Peng","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Savana Bosco","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alison Simmons","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2023.07.26.23293218","rel_title":"Trends and factors associated with neonatal mortality among Neonates hospitalized at the Women and Newborn Hospital in Lusaka Zambia in the pre-covid 19 period","rel_date":"2023-07-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2023.07.26.23293218","rel_abs":"BackgroundNeonatal mortality is a global problem especially in resource-poor settings such as sub-Saharan African Countries.

The Mortality rates were calculated using WHO standard and Microsoft excel 2010 used to construct monthly trends analysis using monthly totals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the factors associated with neonatal deaths at the tertiary facility using Stata version 14.2.

Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF- and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-19, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2 - molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells.

The factors driving the emergence and replacement of novel variants and recombinants remain incompletely understood. Herein, we comprehensively characterized the competitive fitness of SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT) and three variants of concern (VOCs), Alpha, Beta and Delta, by coinfection and serial passaging assays in different susceptible cells. Deep sequencing analyses revealed cell-specific competitive fitness: the Beta variant showed enhanced replication fitness during serial passage in Caco-2 cells, whereas the WT and Alpha variant showed elevated fitness in Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, a high level of neutralizing antibody sped up competition and completely reshaped the fitness advantages of different variants. More importantly, single clone purification identified a significant proportion of homologous recombinants that emerged during the passage history, and immune pressure reduced the frequency of recombination. Interestingly, a recombination hot region located between nucleotide sites 22995 and 28866 of the viral genomes could be identified in most of the detected recombinants. Our study not only profiled the variable competitive fitness of SARS-CoV-2 under different conditions, but also provided direct experimental evidence of homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 viruses, as well as a model for investigating SARS-CoV-2 recombination.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 variants or subvariants keep emerging and the epidemic strains keeps changing in humans and animals. The continued replacement of the epidemic strains was attributed to higher competitive fitness evolved by the newly appeared ones than the older ones, but which factors affect the final outcomes are still not entirely clear. In this study, we performed in vitro coinfection and serial passage with three VOCs and WT under different conditions. Our results showed that the competition outcomes of these viral strains varied in different cell lines or under different immune pressure, confirming the probable effects of these two factors for the competitive fitness of different SARS-CoV-2 viral strains.

While there is abundant information on SCoV-2 RdRp-mediated RNA replication, the influence of interplay among NSP12, NSP7, and NSP8 on template RNA binding and primer extension activity remains relatively unexplored and poorly understood. Here, we recreated a functional RdRp holoenzyme in vitro using recombinant SCoV-2 NSP12, NSP7, and NSP8, and established its functional activity. Subsequently, molecular interactions among the NSPs in the presence of a variety of templates and their effects on polymerase activity were studied, wherein we found that NSP12 alone exhibited notable polymerase activity that increased significantly in the presence of NSP7 and NSP8. However, this activity was completely shut down, and the template RNA-primer complex was detached from NSP12 when one of the two cofactors was present. Through computational analysis, we found that the template RNA entry channel was more constricted in the presence of one of the two cofactors, which was relatively more constricted in the presence of NSP8 compared to that in the presence of NSP7. In conclusion, we report that NSP7 and NSP8 together synergise to enhance the activity of NSP12, but antagonise when present alone. Our findings have implications for novel drug development, and compounds that obstruct the binding of NSP7 or NSP8 to NSP12 can have lethal effects on viral RNA replication.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Deepa Singh","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Tushar Kushwaha","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Rajkumar Kulandaisamy","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Vikas Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kamal Baswal","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Saras H Tiwari","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Arkadyuti Ghorai","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Saroj Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Aparoy Polamarasetty","author_inst":"Faculty of Biology, Indian Institute of Petroleum & Energy, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India."},{"author_name":"Deepak Sehgal","author_inst":"Virology Lab, Department of Life Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."},{"author_name":"Madhumohan R Katika","author_inst":"ESIC Medical College and Hospital, Sanath Nagar, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."},{"author_name":"Suresh Gadde","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada."},{"author_name":"Marceline C\u00f4t\u00e9","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sarala R Kayampeta","author_inst":"R & D Division, Srikara Biologicals Private Limited, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India."},{"author_name":"Mohan B Appaiahgari","author_inst":"R & D Division, Srikara Biologicals Private Limited, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India."},{"author_name":"Krishna K Inampudi","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2023.07.24.23293101","rel_title":"WEIRD or not: A Cross-Cultural Behavioral Economic Assessment of Demand for HIV and COVID-19 Vaccines","rel_date":"2023-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2023.07.24.23293101","rel_abs":"BackgroundDespite empirical evidence supporting vaccine effectiveness, vaccine hesitancy continues to thrive.

Aggregate and individual demand indices (Q0 and Pmax) were computed with nonlinear regressions. Secondary analyses were conducted using repeated measures ANOVAs with vaccine type (COVID-19 and HIV) as the within-subject factor; country, age, and socioeconomic status as between-subjects factors; demand indices served as dependent variables.\n\nResultsDemand indices varied significantly as a function of vaccine type (F (1, 57) = 17.609, p < .001, [Formula]). Demand for HIV vaccines was higher relative to COVID19 vaccines.

Sex- and age-specific immune differences have a wide impact on outcomes from infections and immunisations. Typically, adult females make stronger immune responses and have better disease outcomes but suffer more adverse events following vaccination and are more prone to autoimmune disease. To understand better the mechanisms underlying these differences in vaccine responses, we studied immune responses to two doses of BNT162b2 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in an adolescent cohort (n=34, ages 12-16), an age group previously shown to make significantly greater immune responses to the same vaccine compared to young adults. At the same time, we were able to evaluate immune responses to the co-administered live attenuated influenza vaccine, which has been shown to induce stronger immune responses in adult females. Blood samples from 34 adolescents taken pre- and post-vaccination with COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were assayed for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralising antibodies, and cellular immunity specific for SARS-CoV-2 and endemic betacoronaviruses. IgG targeting influenza lineages contained in the influenza vaccine was also assessed. As previously demonstrated, total IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens were significantly higher among vaccinated adolescents compared to adults (aged 32-52) who received the BNT162b2 vaccine (comparing infection-naive, 49,696 vs 33,339; p=0.03; comparing SARS-CoV-2 previously-infected, 743,691 vs 269,985; p<0.0001) by MSD v-plex assay. However, unexpectedly, antibody responses to BNT162b2 and the live-attenuated influenza vaccine were not higher among female adolescents compared to males; among infection-naive adolescents, antibody responses to BNT162b2 were higher in males than females (62,270 vs 36,951 p=0.008). No sex difference was identified in vaccinated adults. These unexpected findings may result from the introduction of novel mRNA vaccination platforms, generating patterns of immunity divergent from established trends, and providing new insights into what might be protective following COVID-19 vaccination.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecilia Jay","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emily Adland","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna Csala","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Longet","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ane Ogbe","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"Division of Biomedical Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Warwick, UK"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Ellie Barnes","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanna Dunachie","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip Goulder","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2023.07.25.23293143","rel_title":"The Cost of Keeping Patients Waiting: Retrospective Treatment-Control Study of Additional Healthcare Utilisation for UK Patients Awaiting Elective Treatment Following COVID-19","rel_date":"2023-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2023.07.25.23293143","rel_abs":"ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased waiting times for elective treatments in many countries. This study seeks to address a deficit in the literature concerning the effect of long waits on the wider consumption of healthcare resources.\n\nMethodsWe carried out a retrospective treatment-control study in a healthcare system in South West England from 15 June 2021 to 15 December 2021. We compared weekly contacts with health services of patients waiting over 18 weeks for treatment ( Treatments) and people not on a waiting list ( Controls). Controls were matched to Treatments based on age, sex, deprivation and multimorbidity. Treatments were stratified by the clinical specialty of the awaited treatment, with healthcare usage assessed over various healthcare settings. T-tests assessed whether there was an increase in healthcare utilisation and bootstrap resampling was used to estimate the magnitude of any differences.\n\nResultsA total of 44,616 patients were waiting over 18 weeks (the constitutional target in England) for treatment during the study period. Evidence suggests increases (p < 0.05) in healthcare utilisation for all specialties. Patients in the Cardiothoracic Surgery specialty had the largest increase, requiring 17.9 [4.3, 33.8] additional contacts with secondary care and 17.3 [-1.1, 34.1] additional prescriptions per year.\n\nConclusionPeople waiting for treatment consume higher levels of healthcare than comparable individuals not on a waiting list. These findings are relevant for clinicians and managers in better understanding patient need and reducing harm. Results also highlight the possible  false economy in failing to promptly resolve long elective waits.\n\nHighlightsO_LILong waits for elective care can result in additional healthcare needs to manage symptoms up to the point of definitive treatment.

We previously reported descriptive results from the Discover dataset for patients treated with sotrovimab, nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir or molnupiravir, or patients at highest risk per National Health Service (NHS) criteria but who were untreated. This study sought to assess the effectiveness of sotrovimab compared with no early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment in highest-risk patients with COVID-19.\n\nMethodsRetrospective cohort study using the Discover dataset in North West London. Patients had to be non-hospitalised at index, aged [&ge;]12 years old and meet [&ge;]1 of the NHS highest-risk criteria for receiving early COVID-19 treatment with sotrovimab. The primary objective was to assess the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and\/or COVID-19-related death within 28 days of the observed\/imputed treatment date between patients treated with sotrovimab and highest-risk patients who received no early COVID-19 treatment. We also performed subgroup analyses for patients aged <65 and [&ge;]65 years, patients with renal dysfunction, and by Omicron subvariant prevalence period (BA.1\/2 emergence: 1 December 2021-12 February 2022 [period 1]; BA.2 reaching and at its peak: 13 February-31 May 2022 [period 2]; BA.2 falling and BA.4\/5 emergence: 1 June-31 July 2022 [period 3]). Inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity scores was used to adjust for measured known and likely confounders between the cohorts. Cox proportional hazards models with stabilised weights were performed to assess hazard ratios (HRs).\n\nResultsA total of 599 highest-risk patients treated with sotrovimab and 5,191 untreated highest-risk patients were included. Compared with untreated patients, sotrovimab treatment reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death by 50% (HR=0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24, 1.06); however, statistical significance was not reached (p=0.07). In addition, sotrovimab reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation by 57% (HR=0.43; 95% CI 0.18, 1.00) compared with the untreated group, although also not statistically significant (p=0.051). Among patients aged [&ge;]65 years and patients with renal disease, sotrovimab treatment was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation, by 89% (HR=0.11; 95% CI 0.02, 0.82; p=0.03) and 82% (HR=0.18; 95% CI 0.05, 0.62; p=0.007), respectively. In period 1, sotrovimab treatment was associated with a 75% lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death compared with the untreated group (HR=0.25; 95% CI 0.07, 0.89; p=0.032). In periods 2 and 3, HRs of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death were 0.53 (95% CI 0.14, 2.00; p=0.35) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.23, 2.69; p=0.69), respectively, for the sotrovimab versus untreated groups, but differences were not statistically significant.\n\nConclusionsSotrovimab treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in patients aged [&ge;]65 years and those with renal disease compared with the untreated cohort. For the overall cohort, the risk of hospitalisation following sotrovimab treatment was also lower compared with the untreated group; however, this did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.051). The risk of hospitalisation and\/or death was lower for the sotrovimab-treated cohort across all time periods but did not reach significance for periods 2 and 3.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Myriam Drysdale","author_inst":"GSK, Middlesex, UK"},{"author_name":"Evgeniy R.

A human antibody directed at the SARS-CoV-2 Spike N-terminal domain (NTD), DH1052, was recently shown to be non-neutralizing yet it protected mice and cynomolgus macaques from severe disease. The mechanisms of this non-neutralizing antibody-mediated protection are unknown. Here we show that Fc effector functions mediate non-neutralizing antibody (non-nAb) protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA10 viral challenge in mice. Though non-nAb infusion did not suppress infectious viral titers in the lung as potently as NTD neutralizing antibody (nAb) infusion, disease markers including gross lung discoloration were similar in nAb and non-nAb groups. Fc functional knockout substitutions abolished non-nAb protection and increased viral titers in the nAb group. Finally, Fc enhancement increased non-nAb protection relative to WT, supporting a positive association between Fc functionality and degree of protection in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study demonstrates that non-nAbs can utilize Fc-mediated mechanisms to lower viral load and prevent lung damage due to coronavirus infection.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCOVID-19 has claimed over 6.8 million lives worldwide and caused economic and social disruption globally. Preventing more deaths from COVID-19 is a principal goal of antibody biologic and vaccine developers. To guide design of such countermeasures, an understanding of how the immune system prevents severe COVID-19 disease is needed. We demonstrate here that antibody functions other than neutralization can contribute to protection from severe disease. Specifically, the functions of antibodies that rely on its Fc portion were shown to confer antibody-mediated protection of mice challenged with a mouse adapted version of SARS-CoV-2. Mice given an antibody that could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 still showed a decrease in the amount of infectious virus in the lungs and less lung damage than mice given an irrelevant antibody. The decrease in infectious virus in the lungs was even larger when the non-neutralizing antibody was engineered to mediate non-neutralizing effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity more potently. Thus, in the absence of neutralization activity, non-neutralizing binding antibodies can contribute to the overall defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease progression.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Camille  N.

The study also investigated whether the rates returned to pre-pandemic levels by December 2021.\n\nDesignCohort study.\n\nSettingElectronic health records from UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database.\n\nParticipantsThe study included individuals registered with CPRD GOLD between January 2017 and December 2021, with at least 365 days of prior observation.\n\nMain outcome measuresThe study focused on screening, diagnostic tests, referrals and diagnoses of first-ever breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Incidence rates (IR) were stratified by age, sex and region, and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated to compare rates during and after lockdown with the reference period before lockdown. Forecasted rates were estimated using negative binomial regression models.\n\nResultsAmong 5,191,650 eligible participants, the initial lockdown resulted in reduced screening and diagnostic tests for all cancers, which remained dramatically reduced across the whole observation period for almost all tests investigated. For cancer incidence rates, there were significant IRR reductions in breast (0.69), colorectal (0.74), and prostate (0.71) cancers. However, the reduction in lung cancer incidence (0.92) was non-significant. Extrapolating to the entire UK population, an estimated 18,000 breast, 13,000 colorectal, 10,000 lung, and 21,000 prostate cancer diagnoses were missed from March 2020 to December 2021.\n\nConclusionThe national COVID-19 lockdown in the UK had a substantial impact on cancer screening, diagnostic tests, referrals and diagnoses. Although incidence rates started to recover after the lockdown, they remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels for breast and prostate cancers and associated tests.

While several studies have examined the predictive relationships of differing factors on COVID-19 deaths, few have looked at spatiotemporal variation at refined geographic scales. The objective of this analysis is to examine spatiotemporal variation of COVID-19 deaths in association with socioeconomic, health, demographic, and political factors, using regionalized multivariate regression as well as nationwide county-level geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) models. Analyses were performed on data from three sepearate timeframes: pandemic onset until May 2021, May 2021 through November 2021, and December 2021 until April 2022.Regionalized regression results across three time windows suggest that existing measures of social vulnerability for disaster preparedness (SVI) are associated with a higher degree of mortality from COVID-19. In comparison, GWRF models provide a more robust evaluation of feature importance and prediction, exposing the importance of local features, such as obesity, which is obscured by regional delineation. Overall, GWRF results indicate a more nuanced modeling strategy is useful for capturing the diverse spatial and temporal nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erich Seamon","author_inst":"Institute for Modeling Collaboration and Innovation, University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Johnson-Leung","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistical Science, University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Craig R.

To this end, we translate complex clinical quality of care schemes from text descriptions into reusable analytic code.\n\nMethodsWith the approval of NHS England, a population based cohort study was conducted on 25.2 million patient records in situ using OpenSAFELY-TPP. We included all NHS patients registered at general practices using TPP software between March 2019 and March 2023. Individuals that were eligible for blood pressure screening and with a diagnosis of hypertension were identified according to the QOF 2021\/22 business rules. We examined monthly changes in recorded blood pressure screening in the preceding 5 years in patients aged [&ge;] 45, recorded hypertension prevalence, and the recorded percentage of patients treated to target (i.e., [&le;] 140\/90 mmHg for patients [&le;] 79 years and [&le;] 150\/90 mmHg for patients [&ge;] 80 years) in the preceding 12 months, within demographic, regional, and clinical subgroups as well as the variation across practices.\n\nResultsThe overall percentage of patients aged [&ge;] 45 who had blood pressure screening recorded in the preceding 5 years decreased from 90% in March 2019 to 85% in March 2023. Recorded hypertension prevalence was relatively stable at 15% throughout the study period. The percentage of patients with a record of hypertension treated to target in the preceding 12 months reduced from a maximum of 71% in March 2020 to a minimum of 47% in February 2021 in patients aged [&le;] 79 years, and from 85% in March 2020 to a minimum of 58% in February 2021 in patients aged [&ge;] 80 years before recovering. Blood pressure screening rates in the preceding 5 years remained stable in older age groups, patients with a record of learning disability, or care home status.\n\nConclusionsThere was substantial disruption to hypertension management QOF indicators during the pandemic, which can likely be attributed to a general reduction of blood pressure screening. OpenSAFELY can be used to continuously monitor monthly changes in national quality of care schemes to identify changes in key clinical subgroups early and support prioritisation of recovery from disrupted care caused by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Milan Wiedemann","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford,

While the test is extremely sensitive and specific, its high cost and the potential discomfort associated with specimen collection make it suboptimal for public health screening purposes.\n\nIn this study, we developed an equally reliable, but cheaper and less invasive alternative test based on a one-step RT-PCR with the DNA-intercalating dye SYBR Green, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples or RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs. Importantly, we found that this type of testing can be fine-tuned to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.\n\nThe saliva RT-PCR SYBR Green test was successfully used in a mass-screening initiative targeting nearly 4500 asymptomatic children under the age of 12. Testing was performed at a reasonable cost of less than {euro} 0.8 per child, and in some cases, the saliva test outperformed nasopharyngeal rapid antigen tests in identifying infected children. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the antigen testing failure could not be attributed to a specific lineage of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTo further reduce testing costs, we produced all the necessary enzymes and established a new RT-PCR protocol based on the EvaGreen dye. Overall, this work strongly supports the view that RT-PCR saliva tests based on DNA-intercalating dyes represent a powerful strategy for community screening of SARS-CoV-2. The tests can be easily applied to other infectious agents and, therefore, constitute a powerful resource for an effective response to future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sofia M.

N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide have been found to mitigate endothelial damage. The influence on coronary artery endothelial cells of serum collected after 4+\/-1 months from coronavirus infection was studied. The concentrations of serum samples of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor, tissue Plasminogen Activator and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 were studied. The cultures with serum of patients after coronavirus infection were incubated with N-acetylocysteine and Sulodexide to estimate their potential protective role. The blood inflammatory parameters were increased in the group of cultures incubated with serum from patients after coronavirus infection. Supplementation of the serum from patients after coronavirus infection with N-acetylcysteine or Sulodexide reduced the synthesis of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor. No changes in the synthesis of tissue Plasminogen Activator were observed. N-acetylcysteine reduced the synthesis of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide increased the tPA\/PAI-1 ratio. N-acetylcysteine may have a role in reducing the myocardial injury occurring in the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Sulodexide can also play a protective role in post-COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justyna Rajewska-Tabor","author_inst":"University of Medical Sciences in Poznan"},{"author_name":"Patrycja Sosinska","author_inst":"University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Malgorzata Pyda","author_inst":"Poznan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Breborowicz","author_inst":"Poznan University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2023.07.20.23292950","rel_title":"The Political Division toward COVID-19, Vaccines, Contact Tracing Apps, and A Future Pandemic Scenario in the United States: A Survey Result from A National Representative Sample","rel_date":"2023-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2023.07.20.23292950","rel_abs":"ObjectivesTo investigate the attitudes and behaviors of Americans concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines, COVID-19 tracing apps, and the actions they believe the government should take during a public health crisis, we designed and conducted a survey during the ongoing COVID-19 emergency.\n\nMethodsIn January 2022, we administered an online survey on Prolific Academic to 302 participants in the United States, a nationally demographic representative sample. To explore differences in attitudes and opinions among demographic subgroups, we employed several statistical tests, including Mann Whitney U tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and chi-squared tests.\n\nResultsOur survey results suggest that Americans opinions towards the COVID-19 pandemic are severely divided by their political views. There is strong partisan polarization in almost every COVID-19 related question in our survey.\n\nPolicy ImplicationsOur findings suggest that policy makers need to consider partisan polarization and the enormous impact it can have on peoples attitudes and behaviors during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health experts need to consider how to convey scientific knowledge about a pandemic without allowing political views to dominate medical conversation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haijing Hao","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Garrett Smith","author_inst":"Brigham Young University-Provo: Brigham Young University"},{"author_name":"Yunan Chen","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Mainack Mondal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Po-Shen Loh","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Staci Smith","author_inst":"Brigham Young University-Provo: Brigham Young University"},{"author_name":"Xinru Page","author_inst":"Brigham Young University-Provo: Brigham Young University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"}]}
